\section{Experimental Design}

Simple random sampling (SRS): randomly choose subset of individuals from a population (N people) without replacement

Sample $n$ individuals: any subset of $n$ individuals is equally likely

Blocking/controlling for confounding variables: dealing with Simpson's paradox

Randomization: need this often to get independent samples and to meet assumptions for stat. tests

Replication: good experiments should be reproducible! Replacing experiment should yield similar reuslts

Control/baseline comparison: to measure effect of treatment, need ref to compare against.

\section{Stratified Random Sampling}

Block things out, and do simple random sampling (SRS) in each block

For a stratum: how large of a simple random sampling?

\begin{definition}[Proportional Allocation]

Number of individuals in a stratum matches stratum's relative size in population

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Neyman Allocation]

Combines proportional allocation with looking at variances within a strata

Higher variances $\rightarrow$ larger SRS (higher relative size of stratum in population)

\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cluster sampling] 

Previous methods require sampling from whole population or every stratum

Idea: partition population into ``natural'' groups (each group well-represents the population)

\end{definition}

Cluster Sampling:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Randomly sample a few groups
\item For each chosen group, obtain SRS
\end{enumerate}

Example: Polling a city

\begin{enumerate}
\item Divide city into blocks
\item Randomly choose a few blocks
\item Within each chosen block, get SRS
\end{enumerate}

\section{Problem Set Discussion}

$\log{y} = \beta_1 \log{x} + \beta_0 + \epsilon$

$y \propto \exp{beta_0} x^{\beta_1}$

Bat example:

Higher residuals for one group as opposed to another: the model may not be taking into account some factors

\section{Issues (with all Survey Methods)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Getting a list of everyone in population is often hard
\item Non-response bias: many do not respond
\item Question wording matters
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Alfred Landon and Literary Digest}

57\% of respondents supported Landon over Roosevelt in 1936 (biased sample) 

\section{Placebo Effect}

Person gets a sham/dud treatment that is advertised as effective

Then the person reports feeling better (therapeutic effect)

\section{Paired Test, Repeated Measures}

e.g. before, after

2 or more treatments that each subject receives

Example: Want ot measure the effect of caffeine

1 month no caffeine

1 month coffee

1 month tea

Note: there are temporal effects (fancier mehods for adding wit hthis -- autocorrelation models)
